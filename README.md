Welcome to the **Knightfall Engine** — a Justice League themed machine learning app where your favorite DC heroes *actually* guide you through your data, blending interactive analytics with comic book immersion.

## 👾 Project Inspiration

I've always been intrigued by superhero games, especially those story-driven ones where you really feel like part of the team. So for our **AF3005 – Programming** course with Dr. Usama Arshad at LUMS, we thought:  
**Why not make our project something we'd actually have fun building, not just another assignment?**

## 🚀 App Overview

> **Knightfall Engine** is a data analysis web app with a comic book twist.  
> Each Justice League hero comes to life with animated intros, themed dashboards, and unique speech bubbles. Whether it's Batman guiding you through the Batcomputer, Superman flying through regression, or Flash helping you speed through clustering — every hero has their own way of helping you analyze your data.
